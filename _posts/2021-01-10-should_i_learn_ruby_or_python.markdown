Though my first learned programming language was Ruby, I was really on the fence because I had been hearing that Python was the best language to learn. Now that I've learned Ruby and am beginning to work on learning Python, I wanted to highlight some differences between the two that I've encountered.

To start, both are scripting, server-side programming languages. Both are high level, and their programs do not need to be compiled. And in both languages you also don't have to declare variable firsthand. And the great thing about them is there are both available under open-source licenses so you don't need to pay for them. Though they have a few similiarities, it is their differences that are significant.  

When determining which language is best for you it's best to first realize that Python is best for AI, machine learning, and scientific programming. Ruby is best for web development and functional programming. 

Python is also very easy to read and can be written with very few lines of code. It has very simple syntax, and is very straightforward.  Ruby can sometimes be a bit hard to debug and can lots of coding. Python has a larger range of libraries, and Ruby has a smaller range of libraries. I have also noticed that popularity of Python has been growing exponentially, while Ruby has been on a slight decline on the years. 

A few companies that use Ruby are: Apple, Github, Twitter, Hulu
A few companies that use Python are: Google, Instagram, YouTube
