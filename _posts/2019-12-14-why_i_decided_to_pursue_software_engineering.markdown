    I asked myself for quite sometime is software engineering could be a potential career for myself that I would enjoy. After college, I worked in the pharmaceutical industry as an auditor for clinical trials and it was during this time that I gained interest in programming. The Electronic data capture system that we used was pretty horrific and it made my job more difficult. It never created the correct reports and when it did create useful reports, it contained incorrect information. I always had feedback and ideas, but I was considered “The Peanut Gallery” so my thoughts never made past my initial email. I dabbled a little in learning computer programming, but felt the language was too difficult and didn’t make much sense to me, so I stepped back. 

    In my free time , I spend the majority of my time cooking. I love cooking. It’s a passion of mine. I enjoy it because I like to test different recipes, tweak them, and arrive at a final product that is exactly what I’m looking for. I would ask myself, if I add an extra egg, what will happen? If I add more cream, what will happen. I’d record my modifications and then test the final product and see if it’s what I’m looking for. 

    After digging deeper into software development, I realized I would indeed probably enjoy it. I had an AHA moment! I realized that the syntax is not at all the main part of programming. Programming is a mindset! It’s a way of thinking! It’s creative thinking and problem solving! And some aspects of programming are just like cooking! You have a target product that you are trying to code and you have to work to get to that final product, which will entail testing what you have and making tweaks to try to get what you want. It was at this point that I realized I should pursue a career is software engineering. I think it’s something that I will definitely enjoy and after completing the course, I plan to transfer into the programming department within the pharmaceutical industry where I feel I can optimize programs to bring medications to the market quicker, and improve efficiency within Research and Development.
