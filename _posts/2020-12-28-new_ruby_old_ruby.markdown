Ruby had an update! Ruby 3.0. Recently people have thinking that Ruby on Rails was becoming obsolete, but this can show that this is definitely not the case.Â The biggest issue that was solved that I'm interested in is the speed issue. We all know that Ruby's biggest issue is speed, which can hinder us from doing massive projects. The new Ruby is 3x faster than the current Ruby!! This is fantastic! Another issue that I'm excited about is the parrallel computation change. The current Ruby version has a global VM Lock, which means we can't use parrallel computing. The new Ruby will change this and programmers will be able to use parallel threaded computation. The really only bad thing about this update is that the update for this is not automatic. ONce Ruby 3.0 is out we will need to update it manually and some of your current code written in the current Ruby version may be deprecated after the Ruby update, BUT, the current Ruby version will give some warnings in the log and you will know before hand. There is also a plan to add backward compatibility for all the previous Ruby versions, so it won't be too hard to switch from one version to another. Overall, I'm super hyped about this becasue Ruby is my favorite language.
