As I was going back and starting to work on some of my old projects and spruce them up a bit, I remembered that I created one with Sinatra. And then I started to question Rails and how the two of these overlapped and which is better. Rails is a framework focused  on writing model driven web applications, Sinatra is a library for dealing with HTTP from the server side. Sinatra is nothing more than some pre-written methods that we can include in our applications to turn them into Ruby web applications. Rails is better for full integration, while Sinatra is best if you think in terms of HTTP Requests. 

Overall, I like Rails better because I feel like I do more with Rails and it's more robust and works well with large applications whereas Sinatra is best suited for smaller applications. Sinatra is great if your application only has a few endpoints, smaller sites, or API's. Sinatra also allows you to have more control over the architecture of your application. Whereas Rails kind of generates things in one way and may give you more than what you really need. This can be a pain. But Rails can also be faster and generating your layout quickly, so this can save you a lot of time. For me, I like to have a lot of tools at my disposal, so I feel Rails is the better candidate for me. :)
